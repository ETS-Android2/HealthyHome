# Healthy Home


	An application to allow users to easily track, plan, assign, and notify 
	other users of a frequently shared space "Home" of completed and uncompleted 
	tasks. The application is meant to eliminate confusion as to who did or
	does what and when. The application will benifit any shared space by helping
	to promote a shared effort in the upkeep of daily tasks as if the space was their
	home.
	
	Mainly useful:
	*Any type of shared dormatory.
	*Family homes.
	*Roommates.

        Possibly useful for:
	*Resturant crews.
	*Shared office or office's.
	*Prison dorms by inmates via kiosk
	*As a tool for a variety of different work crews.
	*Many more...
	
	Required functionalities:
	: ability to create a Home.
	: ability to add and remove tasks.
	: ability to add and remove members.
	: ability to assign member/members to specific task/task's.
	: task's can usually be self assigned if not already assigned.
	: members of a Home are all viewable to other members.
	: members can also interact with other users of same Home
		such as approving, disapproving, and assiging tasks to 
		other users.
	: any member can select a "Unavailabe" type setting that 
		prevents member from being assigned tasks, also
		notifies other members of unavalability.
