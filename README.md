# HH2


	An application to allow users to easily track, plan, assign, and notify 
	other users of a frequently shared space "Home" of completed and uncompleted 
	tasks. The application is meant to eliminate confusion as to who did or
	does what and when. The application will benifit any shared space by helping
	to promote a shared effort in the upkeep of daily tasks as if the space was their
	home.
